# stock-market-data
This program is a work in progress that parses data from the yfinance library to come up with interesting insights. Currently the main.py file 
takes all of the companies of the S&P 500 and outputs some metrics about them into a csv file. real-margin-calculator asks for a ticker and then calculates
Free Cash Flow (-Stock Based Comp) margin for 2019, 2020, 2021, and TTM.
